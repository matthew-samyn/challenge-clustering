### challenge-clustering
# Description
This was a solo project during my education at BeCode. 
The goal was to get more familiar with different clustering algorithms and their evaluation methods. For this assignment we had to use a dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/isaienkov/bearing-classification" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. 

# Goals
* Get more familiar with different clustering algorithms
* Learn how to handle different cluster evalution methods.
* Learn how to compare different cluster algorithms to each other.
* Gain more knowledge on fft and how it can be used.

NOTE:
In the past I had already worked on this dataset, so the data had already been cleaned and preprocessed to apply clustering.

# Installation
## Python version
* Python 3.9


## Packages used
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot
* seaborn
* sklearn
* plotly
* itertools
* yellowbrick

## Databases
Github has a 100MB file limit, so the original .csv files can't be found in this repository.  
Below however, you can find the links to both original files.
